# Unity_2D Random Dungeon Generation

In this project I was set to learn about the basics of 2D Level design for an Isometric Twin Stick Shooter, to be worked on in the near future (after graduation)

This was primarily used to teach me the basics of navigation tiling as well as optimized randomization.

Using Transform potentials and optimal distance measures I was able to make quick an easy loadout sequence where N amount of tiles need to be set and a certain distance of travelable tile must be created (although a lot of short comings with scene still persist).

Using optimized while loops and multi-threaded co routines help me create an efficient loadout for a small game of this magnitude.

Any improvements to the scene will be updated here in the Master ReadMe
